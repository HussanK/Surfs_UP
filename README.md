# Surfs_UP

## Overview of Prject

The purpose of this project was to gain better understanding of SQLite and SQLAlchemy, and to gain further our understanding of numpy and pandas.  two libraries in pytohon that 
help you read and manipulate .csv files or "comma separated variable' files. To complete this challenge and module we had to have an understanding of how to read sqlite data 
bases and display the selected data. Then we used numpy and pandas to take that data and put it into a dataframe and then analyze it. 

## Results 

Below is the results of the analysis for each month:

![June](https://github.com/HussanK/Surfs_UP/blob/main/june.png)
![December](https://github.com/HussanK/Surfs_UP/blob/main/dec.png)

- As you can see the mean temperature of June is about 3 degrees higher than that of December
- The minimum temp in June was 8 degree warmer at 64 then December's 54
- The maximum temp in December was only two degrees colder than June at 83 and 85 repectively. 

 
 ## School_Data_Analysis Summary
 
 THe results of this data show that a surf and ice cream shop would be sustainable all year round. During the winter months it would get colder which means business could slow,
 but it still remains warm enough for people to enjoy ice cream and surfing. Two other queries I would run are the avg rainfall during the months, and average wind speed as both
 of these could affect the waves and the temperature potentially further affecting his business.
